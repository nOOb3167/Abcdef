Need to use Mingw45 libintl-8.dll for compiling.
Need to use OBS     libintl-8.dll for running.

Have Mingw45 (Located in OBS24/bin) earlier in path by default.
wr.bat prepends a directory containing just the OBS intl.

Of course I could just revert to libintl-8.dll from
Abcdef_deps_001_2011_6_30.7z
But that would be too easy right?
